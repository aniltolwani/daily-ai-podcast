generate a daily podcast of the top AI papers using NotebookLM

# Implementation Plan

**Updated Product Specification for Daily AI Papers Podcast Automation**

---

### **1. Introduction**

The goal is to automate the creation of a daily podcast summarizing top AI papers, focusing on simplicity and efficiency. The system will:

- Use Zapier to monitor your Gmail for the arrival of the AInews email and trigger a webhook.
- Use Google's NotebookLM to generate audio summaries (mp3 files) of the papers.
- Stitch the audio summaries together, creating smooth transitions and accurate timestamps.
- Publish the final podcast to Spotify, using an RSS feed if necessary, in the simplest way possible.
- Deploy the entire system on an easy-to-use platform like Replit or Railway.

---

### **2. High-Level Architecture**

1. **Email Monitoring Module**: Uses Zapier to detect the arrival of the AInews email in Gmail and sends a webhook to trigger the pipeline.
2. **Content Generation Module**: Generates audio summaries using NotebookLM.
3. **Audio Processing Module**: Combines audio files and adds transitions.
4. **Publishing Module**: Publishes the podcast to Spotify via an RSS feed using a simple podcast hosting service.
5. **Deployment**: The entire system runs on Replit or Railway for simplicity.

---

### **3. Functional Requirements**

#### **3.1 Email Monitoring Module**

- **Functionality**:
  - Use Zapier to monitor your Gmail inbox for the AInews email.
  - When the email arrives, Zapier sends a webhook to your application to trigger the pipeline.
  - The application accesses the email content via Gmail API to parse and extract paper titles and URLs.

- **Files**:
  - `email_monitor.py`: Handles the webhook received from Zapier and retrieves the email content.

- **Design Decisions**:
  - Using Zapier simplifies email monitoring without writing complex polling code.
  - Zapier's Gmail integration can detect new emails based on specific criteria (e.g., sender, subject).
  - Webhooks provide a quick and efficient way to trigger your application as soon as the email arrives.

#### **3.2 Content Generation Module**

- **Functionality**:
  - Automate interactions with NotebookLM to generate audio summaries (mp3 files) for each paper.
  - Download the generated mp3 files.

- **Files**:
  - `content_generator.py`: Orchestrates the content generation process, including automating NotebookLM interactions.

- **Design Decisions**:
  - Use Playwright or Selenium for browser automation.
  - Ensure the automation script can log in, process paper URLs, and download mp3 files efficiently.

#### **3.3 Audio Processing Module**

- **Functionality**:
  - Combine the mp3 files into a single audio file.
  - Add simple transitions between summaries.
  - Generate timestamps for each segment.

- **Files**:
  - `audio_processor.py`: Handles merging audio files and adding transitions.

- **Design Decisions**:
  - Use a simple audio processing library like Pydub.
  - Keep transitions minimalâ€”use brief silence or a simple sound effect.

#### **3.4 Publishing Module**

- **Functionality**:
  - Publish the final podcast to Spotify.
  - Use a podcast hosting service that automatically generates an RSS feed compatible with Spotify.
  - Manage episode details like title, description, and timestamps.

- **Files**:
  - `publisher.py`: Handles uploading the podcast to the hosting service.

- **Design Decisions**:
  - Use a simple podcast hosting platform like Anchor.fm (now Spotify for Podcasters) or Buzzsprout.
  - These platforms simplify the publishing process and handle RSS feed generation automatically.
  - They also integrate directly with Spotify, making publishing straightforward.

### **4. Simplified Workflow**

1. **Email Monitoring and Triggering**:
   - **Zapier Setup**:
     - Create a Zap that connects Gmail to a webhook.
     - Trigger: New email in Gmail matching specific criteria.
     - Action: Send a POST request to your application's webhook URL.

2. **Email Retrieval and Parsing**:
   - `email_monitor.py` receives the webhook and extracts necessary data.
   - Access the email content via Gmail API using the message ID provided by Zapier.
   - Parse the email to extract paper titles and URLs.

3. **Content Generation**:
   - `content_generator.py` uses automation to interact with NotebookLM.
   - Generates and downloads mp3 summaries for each paper.

4. **Audio Processing**:
   - `audio_processor.py` combines the mp3 files.
   - Adds simple transitions (e.g., brief silence).
   - Generates timestamps.

5. **Publishing**:
   - `publisher.py` uploads the final audio file to the podcast hosting platform.
   - The hosting platform generates an RSS feed and distributes the podcast to Spotify.

### **5. Steps to Set Up Zapier Hook**

- **Create a Zapier Account**: Sign up for a free Zapier account if you don't have one.

- **Create a New Zap**:
  1. **Trigger**:
     - App: Gmail
     - Event: New Email Matching Search
     - Connect your Gmail account.
     - Set up search criteria (e.g., from: "ainews@example.com", subject contains: "AI News").
  2. **Action**:
     - App: Webhooks by Zapier
     - Event: POST
     - Set up the webhook:
       - URL: The endpoint of your application (e.g., `https://yourapp.repl.co/webhook`)
       - Payload Type: JSON
       - Include data from the email (e.g., message ID, subject, sender).
  3. **Test the Zap**: Ensure it triggers correctly and sends the webhook.

- **Configure Your Application to Receive the Webhook**:
  - In `email_monitor.py`, set up a simple web server using Flask or FastAPI to receive the POST request.
  - Extract the message ID from the webhook payload.

- **Access the Email Content**:
  - Use Gmail API to retrieve the email content using the message ID.
  - Parse the email to extract paper titles and URLs.

### **6. Publishing to Spotify via RSS Feed**

#### **Simplest Way to Publish**

- **Use Spotify for Podcasters (formerly Anchor.fm)**:
  - **Benefits**:
    - Free and user-friendly.
    - Direct integration with Spotify.
    - Automatically generates an RSS feed for your podcast.
  - **Steps**:
    1. **Create an Account**: Sign up at [Spotify for Podcasters](https://podcasters.spotify.com/).
    2. **Create a Podcast**: Follow the prompts to set up your podcast.
    3. **Upload Episodes**:
       - In `publisher.py`, automate the upload using Spotify for Podcasters API (if available) or manually upload the episode.
       - Alternatively, use email-based publishing if supported.
    4. **Manage Podcast Details**: Set the title, description, and episode notes.

- **Alternative: Use a Simple Podcast Hosting Service**

  - **Buzzsprout**:
    - Offers a free plan with limited storage.
    - Simple interface and automatic RSS feed generation.
    - Distributes your podcast to Spotify and other platforms.
    - API access may be limited; manual upload might be necessary.

- **Automating the Publishing Process**

  - **Option 1: Use APIs**:
    - Some podcast hosting services offer APIs to automate episode uploads.
    - Check if the chosen platform provides an API or supports FTP uploads.

  - **Option 2: Use Email-based Publishing**:
    - Some platforms allow you to publish episodes via email.
    - Send an email with the audio file attached to a specific address.

  - **Option 3: Manual Upload**:
    - If automation is not possible, consider manually uploading the episodes initially.
    - Simplifies the development process, focusing on automation later.
